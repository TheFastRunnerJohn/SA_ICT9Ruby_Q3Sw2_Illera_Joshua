					There's not just one thing I love about this show, everything that goes into the show, how the creators treat their fans, to the characters created, to the writing, everything what makes this what it is I love.

					<td>The opening scene shows Wade Wilson, the superhero Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) in a cab, bored in the backseat. He squeezes himself thru the small window between the back and front seats to chat with the cabbie, Dopinder (Karan Soni). Deadpool asks Dopinder about a picture of a girl he has in his car, and Dopinder says she was his girlfriend until he lost her to his cousin. Deadpool tells Dopinder to hold on tightly to the love he feels for the woman in the picture. Dopinder then takes Deadpool to the middle of a bridge, and Deadpool stiffs the man for cab fare.</td>
					<td>Ryan Reynolds acting as Deadpool or Wade Wilson, Morena Baccarin as Vanessa, Ed Skrein as Ajax</td>
					<td>Hetvi Shah.. 10/10 <br> 

						Funny, entertaining and refreshing !!

						The first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that's exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.</td>

					<td>Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) destroys the Supreme Intelligence, the artificial intelligence that leads the Kree empire. This leads to a civil war and the desolation of the Kree home world, Hala, over the next 30 years. The conflict renders the planet barren as it loses its air, water, and sunlight.</td>
					<td>Brie Larson acting as Carol Denvers aka Captain Marvel, Iman Vellani acting as Ms. Marvel Zawe Ashton acting as Dar-Benn</td>
					<td>
						Jacques Van Zyl.. 10/10

						Exceptional performance by Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris and Iman Vellani as Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel, Monica Rambeau and Kamala Khan / Ms. Marvel respectively. Samuel L. Jackson is back with a fury as Nick Fury and bringing the much-needed energy and comic relief as usual. <br>

					I highly encourage watching the following Marvel movies and TV series in order to thoroughly prepare for The Marvels:

						- Avengers: Infinity War (2018)
						- Captain Marvel (2019)
						- Avengers: Endgame (2019)
						- WandaVision (2021)
						- Ms. Marvel (2022)
						- Secret Invasion (2023)
